I will upload a very rough file structure or some of which in about a week or so. (I have a lot of research to do..)</h4>


The goal of this project is to create a system that can accept input via web forms (to be approved by admins) and append them to appropriate database that will then populate to a webpage.

Theory of Operation: Visitor inputs data --> Data Saved to Database ---> Admin Verifies/approves Data ----> Data is displayed on webpage.

Webpage Design & Operation: Databse data value1 (or column1?) of an entry is displayed on page as links, when clicked these will direct visitor to a webpage with all of the Database values for that entry/column. Additionally, similar data should be organized in browsable categories via web page.

I'm an amateur coder and I think this would be a great project to get my feet wet.

I intend to provide a good-hearted non-profit service to the world with this system, and it can also be used by others for other informational webpages.

I'd appreciate any help. I think I've got the gathering of information figured out however I will be struggling with Database organization and admin-verification of the data visitors submit, and implementing anti-spam efforts. I will also need help creating the backend dashboard to moderate data (that's currently beyond my skillset).

Frontend website: Visitors view organized data and can click an item/entry (displayed as textual link) that directs to a page showing more data about the specific entry, and possibly a photos.

Backend: Data can be verified before becoming public and being viewable publicly. Admin can edit data, contact the person that posted the data, etc.

I'll add more details and rewrite this description in the future.

Realistically, I don't even know where to begin. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
